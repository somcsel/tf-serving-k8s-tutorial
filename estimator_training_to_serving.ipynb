    "# Serving a TF Estimator Resnet Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** In TensorFlow 1.3, a higher level API called Estimators was introduced and has since been a popular API of choice within the TensorFlow community. Suppose that an ML researcher has trained a Resnet model on the Imagenet dataset using TensorFlow's Estimator API, located at https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/v1.4.0/official/resnet. (Note that we used v1.4.0. You always want to use a stable tag for a model version to deploy as the researcher can continue to modify the model and architecture at the head of master.) Our task is to deploy this model into TensorFlow Serving. You have access to their python code as well as a saved state (checkpoint) that points to their favorite trained result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook teaches how to use the Estimator API to create a servable version of a pre-trained Resnet 50 model trained on ImageNet. The servable model can be served using [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/serving/), which runs very efficiently in C++ and supports multiple platforms (different OSes, as well as hardware with different types of accelerators such as GPUs). The model will need to handle RPC prediction calls coming from a client that sends requests containing a batch of jpeg images. "

    "\n",
    "The [TensorFlow Estimator API](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/estimators) is an abstraction that simplifies the process of training, evaluation, prediction, and serving. Central to the Estimator API is an argument called the model function (model_fn). Essentially, a model function defines which graph nodes are used in training, evaluation, and prediction. Depending on the mode (TRAIN, EVAL, PREDICT) used, the model function will return an [EstimatorSpec](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.3/extend/estimators#constructing_the_model_fn) object tell the Estimator to run different graph nodes. The typical behavior of a model function would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* TRAIN mode calls an optimizer that is hooked to a loss function (e.g. cross-entropy). This loss function is hooked to a node that contains the training labels, as well as a node that computes predicted logits for each class (which is hooked to nodes in lower layers of the network, etc., and finally hooked to the input placeholder nodes).\n",
    "* EVAL mode does not call the optimizer, but calls the loss function and potentially, other evaluation metric (e.g. accuracy). These evaluation metrics will likely depend on labels as well as the node computing predicted logits for each class.\n",
    "  * Additionally, researchers will often use monitors and hooks during training and evaluation to check on the progress of the model. Usually, these components are used to return summaries about different layers of the network, such as model coefficients, etc., which can be visualized using [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard).\n",
    "* PREDICT mode does NOT require an optimizer as there is no training step, and no label or loss functions (which depend on the label). Instead, predictions simply try to provide clients/users with information of interest, such as the most likely label for an image, the probability of the image being of a particular class, etc., which depend on graph components such as the logits node, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** Below is the training code used in the imagenet_main.py [resnet_model_fn()](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/v1.4.0/official/resnet/imagenet_main.py#L162), renamed to serving_model_fn(). Portions of the code are modified and refactored into separate helper functions for debugging purposes.

    "[TensorFlow unit testing](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/test) is a more software engineer oriented approach to run tests. By writing test classes that can be invoked individually when building the project, calling tf.test.main() will run all tests and return a list of ones that succeeded and failed, allowing you to inspect errors. Because we are in a notebook environment, such a test would not succeed due to an already running kernel that tf.test cannot access. The tests must be run from the command line, e.g. `python test_my_graph.py`.\n",

    "**Exercise**: Messages from our [client](https://github.com/google-aai/tf-serving-k8s-tutorial/blob/master/client/resnet_client.py) arrive as a dictionary of the form {'images': array_of_jpeg_strings}. However, the ResNet network expects a 4D tensor, where dimension 0 corresponds to the index of an image, and the other dimensions correspond to pixels of each image. We will wrap our JPEG decoding helper function in another helper function that converts the client message into an array of 3D tensors, and then pack them into a 4D tensor. Follow the TODOs in the code below to complete the preprocess_input() helper function.\n",
